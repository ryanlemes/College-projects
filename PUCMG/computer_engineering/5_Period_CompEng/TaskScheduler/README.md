# Task Scheduler


### Problem
Let X = {x1, x2, ..., xn} be a set of T computational tasks; where ti is the time required to process xi and W is the total time available for processing in the system. Select the subset of tasks Z âŠ‚ X such that the idle time of the computational system is minimized. The solutions must be presented using brute force, a greedy algorithm, and dynamic programming, as studied in the lectures. The group may use the random set generator provided in the course materials. The implementations should investigate: (a) the time required to solve each instance of the proposed problem and (b) the size of the largest possible set with a solution provided within a maximum time of 5 seconds.
